# Welcome to Ink

Ink is an interface kit for quick development of web interfaces, simple to use and expand on. It uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to offer modern solutions for building layouts, display common interface elements and implement interactive features that are content-centric and user friendly for both your audience and your designers & developers.

## Getting started

Let's get you started with Ink right away. Here's what you need to know and do:

1. Download latest build.
2. Open my-page.html if you want to serve Ink from your host or my-cdn-page.html if you want to serve Ink from our servers.
3. Check the template we provide and remove whatever you don't feel necessary for your project.
4. Make sure you have ink.css, ink-ie.css and ink.js included somewhere in the `<head>`.
5. Add your own stylesheets and scripts to carry all your project-specific changes.
6. Keep coming back to the documentation to help you along the way.
7. That's it! You'll see how easy it is once you pick it up.
